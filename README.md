## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. In this repository, we explore basic NLP tasks using the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library in Python.

In this repository, you'll find code examples that demonstrate various NLP techniques using NLTK. The examples cover the following topics:

- **Segmentation**: Splitting text into sentences.
- **Tokenization**: Breaking sentences into words.
- **Removal of Stop Words**: Removing common words that don't carry much meaning.
- **Stemming and Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their root forms.
- **Part of Speech Tagging**: Tagging each word with its part of speech.
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Identifying named entities like persons, organizations, locations, etc.

### Segmentation

In NLP, breaking text into sentences and words is a common initial step. NLTK provides tools to facilitate this.

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize, word_tokenize

text = "Millions of people across the UK and beyond have celebrated..."
sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
words = word_tokenize(sentences[2])
print(sentences)
print(words) python
```
### Punctuation Removal
Eliminating punctuation is often necessary for various text processing tasks.

```python
import re

text = re.sub(r"[^a-zA-Z0-9]", " ", sentences[2])
print(text)
```
### Tokenization
Tokenization involves splitting text into individual words.

```python
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

words = word_tokenize(text)
print(words)
```
### Removal of Stop Words
Stop words are common words frequently removed in NLP analysis.

```python
nltk.download('stopwords')
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

words = [w for w in words if w not in stopwords.words("english")]
print(words)
```

### Stemming and Lemmatization
Stemming and lemmatization are linguistic processes to reduce words to their base forms.

```python
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
pos_tags = nltk.pos_tag(words)
print(pos_tags)
```

### Part of Speech Tagging
Part of speech tagging involves labeling words with their grammatical attributes.

```python
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
pos_tags = nltk.pos_tag(words)
print(pos_tags)
```
### Named Entity Recognition
Named Entity Recognition (NER) identifies named entities within text.

```python
nltk.download('words')
from nltk import ne_chunk

ner_tree = ne_chunk(pos_tags)
print(ner_tree)
```

### Examples
Here are a few examples showcasing Named Entity Recognition:

```python
text = "Twitter CEO Elon Musk arrived at the Staples Center..."
ner_tree = ne_chunk(pos_tag(word_tokenize(text)))
print(ner_tree)
```

Feel free to explore and expand upon these exercises to deepen your understanding of NLP concepts and NLTK library utilization.

Happy learning!
