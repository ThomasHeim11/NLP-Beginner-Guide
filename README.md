## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. In this repository, we explore basic NLP tasks using the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library in Python.

In this repository, you'll find code examples that demonstrate various NLP techniques using NLTK. The examples cover the following topics:

- **Segmentation**: Splitting text into sentences.
- **Tokenization**: Breaking sentences into words.
- **Removal of Stop Words**: Removing common words that don't carry much meaning.
- **Stemming and Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their root forms.
- **Part of Speech Tagging**: Tagging each word with its part of speech.
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Identifying named entities like persons, organizations, locations, etc.

## Segmentation

In NLP, breaking text into sentences and words is a common initial step. NLTK provides tools to facilitate this.

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize, word_tokenize

text = "Millions of people across the UK and beyond have celebrated..."
sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
words = word_tokenize(sentences[2])
print(sentences)
print(words)









## Getting Started

To run the code examples in this repository, make sure you have Python and NLTK installed. You can install NLTK using the following command:

'''pip install nltk''
